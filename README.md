# Bookstore

## In this project following processes will be achieved :

- Initialise React app.
- The building blocks of the app should be set as re-usable components. Create a directory for the components.
- Add React Router and set two <Route>s and <Link>s for the app's navigation.
- Books - the default view: Should display the list of books (empty at this point but it should be ready for the data) with the Remove button (no funcionality yet).
- Create a component called Book for displaying a single book (receive a title and an author as prop) and reuse it in a component that displays a list of books.
- Should display a form for adding a book (no functionality yet).
- Create a separate component for this form (with inputs for a title and an author).
- Categories: Should display a button "Check status" only.
